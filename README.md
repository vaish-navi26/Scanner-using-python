# Scanner-using-python

The Python script presented in this report is a rudimentary network port scanner. It accepts user-defined parameters, including the target host's IP address, a range of ports for scanning, and a connection timeout. The script then attempts to connect to each port within the specified range, categorising them as "OPEN" if a successful connection is made or "CLOSED" if the connection attempt fails. It also records the time taken for the entire scanning process. While this script serves as a basic illustration of port scanning, it is important to acknowledge that professional network security assessments rely on more sophisticated tools that consider
various factors, such as firewalls and advanced scanning techniques.

The project has provided valuable insights into the fundamental concepts and practical aspects of network scanning. It introduced a basic Python script for port scanning, demonstrating its capability to identify open and closed ports on a target host. While the script is a rudimentary illustration, it underscores the importance of network scanning in security assessments.

STEPS:
1. run main.py
2. enter hostname as localhost
3. result: will show no. of ports open on the host
